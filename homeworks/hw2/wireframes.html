					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> 
								Youtube:
								<img class="img-scaled" src = "assets/imgs/hw_2wireframes-1.png"
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> <img class="img-scaled" src = "assets/imgs/hw_2wireframes-2.png" </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> 
								The goal of this website is to provide videos for viewers to watch. The design makes searching for videos easy, as there are many categories,
								a clear search bar location, and many random video recommendations.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> I felt the dropdown near the top left made the top area a bit cluttered, so I moved it down and made the logo bigger to fill its space.
								I also feel like some users would prefer to hide the categories keyword menu so I added a dropdown to hide it. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
