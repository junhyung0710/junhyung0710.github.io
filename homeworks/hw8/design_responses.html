				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Forced continuity is the concept of free trials that are difficult to opt out of. 
							This dark design pattern baits the user into a "free" option when in reality the intent is to trick them into forgetting to cancel their membership.
							They make the cancellation either very difficult or time consuming.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article was the sheer amount of examples they supplied. These examples help paint a valuable framework of what to avoid in terms of dark design.
							In addition, I found myself relating to experiencing these in the past (especially the free trial one). </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> “Yes, the info in the blogs is bad, false, and misleading but the rationale is that ‘if it gets the people to click on it and engage, then use it.” </p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
