							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> To meet W3C's minimum AA rating, background-to-text contrast ratio should at least be 4:5:1.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The introduction of focus states was my favorite part because even though I am not visual impaired, I have personally found a lot of use in focus states.
								Being able to navigate a site with just the keyboard is often super useful and convenient. This part has made me keep in mind incorporating this in my own future websites. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> All browsers have a default focus state color, but if you plan on overriding that within your product, it’s crucial to ensure you’re providing enough color contrast.</p>
