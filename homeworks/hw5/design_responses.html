                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned that some of these animations on this website made me really dizzy. 
                                It made me realize the importance of keeping animations simple enough to not take away from functionality.
                                Animations that kept this in mind actually helped improve functionality in my opinion. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite animation was the AI Powered Assistant. In particular, the slow zooms and blue pathing through the map were very comprehensible and appealing to the eye.
                                It gave it a very futuristic feel, which was very visually appealing.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> Since I described my favorite animation in my previous question, I'll answer my second favorite in this one.
                                The cryptocurrency animation stood out to me as my second favorite as its continuous design really draws the user in, keeping the user engaged in what is basically a loading screen.
                                It reminds me of the colorful nature of casinos, which when applied to crypto, could potentially lead to more spending.

                            <p> 9, I really enjoyed the inspirational animations that I hopefully will draw from in the future. </p>
