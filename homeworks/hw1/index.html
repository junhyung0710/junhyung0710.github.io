            Hi, I'm Junesoo but I go by John, and a fun fact about me is that I've been playing the electric guitar for 10 years.

        <ul>
            <li>1. I learned how one of my favorite platforms (Spotify)
                 utilizes useful tools such as continuing to play the song in view while users are navigating. 
                 This seems to be add to the Spotify interface's interactability with users.</li>
            <li>2. My favorite part of the article was the clear separation of things to look out for in a app in terms of design into 4 categories.</li>
            <li>3. As you watch each component build upon the next, be curious about everything you see and think through the choices that had to be made for this product.</li>
            <li>4. 7, especially since one of my favorite interfaces (Spotify) was included.</li>
