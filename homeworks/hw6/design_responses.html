						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Trying to mimic the behavior of real world physics seems to be an intersting point that I had not considered. Incorporating acceleration and decceleration on certain animations makes a lot of sense to mimic the real world and apply those priniciples to make animations look smoother. Other applications I imagine are applying gravity to accelerate objects falling down. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the good animations included side by side with bad animations. For each point they made, adding the visual representation helped a lot as I am a visual learner. They also gave good inspiration for what good animation ideas I could go for in the future. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> According to Material Design Guidelines, it is better to use an asymmetric curve to make the movement look more natural and realistic. The end of the curve must be more emphasized than its beginning, so that the duration of acceleration is shorter than that of slowing down.</p>
