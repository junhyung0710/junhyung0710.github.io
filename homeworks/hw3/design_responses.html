							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think my favorite part of the article was the statement that you should research a font's intended purpose.
								Font's being created with an intended purpose is not something that I really have thought much about before this article.
								Now, I think I will try to research font purposes before adding a random font I have found. </p>
